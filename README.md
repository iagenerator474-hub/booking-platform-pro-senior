## 🔍 Feedback wanted

This repository is a **reference backend project**, not a SaaS or a production product.

I’m sharing it to get **technical feedback**, especially on:
- Stripe Checkout webhook flow (signature, idempotence, retries)
- Express backend structure & boundaries
- Prisma schema, constraints, and transactions
- Security hardening (cookies, rate limiting, trust boundaries)

No need to run the project or open a PR — **comments and issues are more than enough**.
